## aSSIsT: Secure Software for the Internet of Things

aSSIsT is a five-year project (March 2018 - February 2023) on Cybersecurity
funded by [SSF](https://strategiska.se/).
It brings together researchers from the
[Department of Information Technology](http://www.it.uu.se/)
of Uppsala University, and from [RISE SICS](https://www.sics.se/).

### Open Positions:

- 1 Post-Doctoral Position
- 3 PhD positions

on Techniques for Detecting and Removing Security Vulnerabilities in Software.
The topic for the positions is to develop techniques for detecting and removing security vulnerabilities in software, and applying these techniques in software for IoT devices.
You are welcome to submit your application no later than 2018-04-23, through the full announcement:
- for Post-Doctoral position (UFV-PA 2018/1007) [here](http://uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/details/?positionId=200110)
- For PhD positions (UFV-PA 2018/955) [here](http://uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/details/?positionId=198569)


### Background

The Internet of Things (IoT) is now becoming an integrated part of our
society's infrastructure. The IoT includes a large number of small
embedded devices that are connected to each other and the internet.
IoT devices act as the interface between the physical and the digital
world, enabling real-time insights into physical world dynamics. IoT
systems are being deployed in a range of application domains, including
factories, hospitals, as well as smart buildings and homes. Swedish industry
and research has played a leading role in this development: IoT technology
is an important offering of many Swedish companies, and several key
technologies, such as [Contiki OS](http://www.contiki-os.org/),
have a leading role in IoT system development.

### Challenge

The existing software infrastructure for IoT represents an impressive
effort to equip small devices with advanced functionality. Now that the
IoT revolution is here, society and industry face the challenge to use
this software basis for building systems with the highest levels of
security and safety.

### Goal

The goal of aSSIsT is to enable IoT system developers to meet this challenge,
by providing them with powerful techniques that can detect and remove security
vulnerabilities in software, ensure that security protocols provide guaranteed
functionality, which prevent, detect, and mitigate intrusions when they occur.
These techniques must furthermore be integrated in existing development process
for IoT systems, by automating them and by focusing on low-power, battery-operated
wireless devices, such as those found in IoT systems.
