Home page of the aSSIsT project

# Basics

# Local Testing
If you want to check the webpage locally, you need to install Jekyll. You can then run `jekyll s` from the command line to host the page locally (default http://localhost:4000)

# Posts
To create new posts, one only needs to as a markdown file in the `_posts/` directory with the naming convention `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` and the post is automatically added to the webpage.

# Pages

To add more pages that are to appear in the menu on the top of the page, one needs to add these as name.md in the root directory. These pages are put in the menu in alphabetical order so they are prefixed with numbers (e.g. `01-about.md`). Check one of the existing files to see how they are written.

# Files

To provide files for downloading, place them in the `files/` directory.

# Todo

The about page is a bit barebone
